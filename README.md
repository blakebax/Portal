## PORTAL

Portal is a simple subject management tool written using MVC3 with Razor syntax, CSS3, C#, and jQuery.
The datastorage is done in a simple text file with the data being serialized json. 
All events (the few that there are) are handled through simple ajax calls. With a small dataset such as this it's quite fast.
I didn't give to much thought to security in the design, as was mentioned in the reequirements.

Have Fun!!!

Additional improvements that could be made with more time:

- More awesome movie characters added.

- Editing functionality

- Tidy up the UI
